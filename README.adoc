= Async and Modal MIDI Input in NeoVim

== About

This NeoVim plugin is effectively a wrapper -- albeit a pretty advanced one -- around {url-lmi}[lilypond-midi-input], inspired by how {url-frescobaldi}[Frescobaldi] and {url-denemo}[Denemo] handle MIDI input. The main goal is to allow using a MIDI keyboard to insert notes into your lilypond scores.

The main reason a MIDI handler was not implemented in Lua and thus directly into NeoVim, is because of a seeming lack of comprehensive libraries. There are a few MIDI related libraries, but by their descriptions they only appear to work on MIDI files, not real-time MIDI input from a device. (Also it was a good excuse for me to use Rust again, and the resulting backend could in theory be used outside NeoVim)

== Features

[NOTE]
Bullet points with an arrow right after can be clicked on and expanded to show a *demo video*!


* All features from {url-lmi-features}[lilypond-midi-input], reflected during inserting/replacing of notes


* Respects vim modes (see {url-vim-modes}[`:h vim-modes`])

** Notes are only inserted when in *Insert mode*
** Notes are replaced when in *Replace mode*
** Nothing will happen in any other mode
** Open to view demo

* Always puts cursor right after inserted/replaced note for quick editing (i.e. add articulations, etc.)


* Puts appropriate spacing around inserted notes


* Options to change behaviour
** See all {url-lmi-options}[options from lilypond-midi-input]
** (Global) alterations can be given as lua tables in the config
** `replace_q` on whether to replace a {url-lilypond-chords}[`q`]. If disabled, behaves like {url-frescobaldi}[Frescobaldi]'s replace.
** `debug` for debugging issues or undesired behaviour; will disable note input


* List of MIDI devices to select from when none is specified, or when the specified one is not available


* Comprehensive update menu for discoverable options (`:MidiInputUpdateOptions`)


* Autocommands to make for a more seamless experience
** Stop MIDI input upon closing vim (if forgotten to stop manually with `:MidiInputStop`)
** Find the previous chord upon entering insert/replace mode (and sets {url-lmi-options}[`previous-chord`])
** Find the previous key signature upon entering insert/replace mode (and sets {url-lmi-options}[`key`])
** Finds arbitrary options in the lilypond source file for {url-lmi-options}[lilypond-midi-input] which are passed as-is to the backend
